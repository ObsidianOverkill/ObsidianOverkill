        <h1>The Lion</h1>
        <p>A lion is a large and powerful cat that lives in Africa and India.
            It has a muscular body, a short tail, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. 
            Male lions have a mane of fur around their necks. 
            Lions are social animals that live in groups called prides. 
            They hunt mostly at night and eat large animals like zebras and antelopes.</p>

        <h1>The Tiger</h1>
        <p> A tiger is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. 
        It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white 
        underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild
         boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring 
         large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing
         of its offspring. </p>

<h1>The SnowLeopard</h1>
<p>A snow leopard (Panthera uncia), commonly known as the ounce, 
    is a species of large cat in the genus Panthera of the family Felidae
    . The species is native to the mountain ranges of Central and South Asia.
     It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because the global population
      is estimated to number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals and is expected 
      to decline about 10% by 2040. It is mainly threatened by poaching and habitat
       destruction following infrastructural developments. It inhabits alpine and
        subalpine zones at elevations of 3,000–4,500 m (9,800–14,800 ft), ranging 
        from eastern Afghanistan, the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau to southern
         Siberia, Mongolia and western China. In the northern part of its range,
          it also lives at lower elevations. </p>

    <h1>The Jaguar</h1>
<p>
    A jaguar (Panthera onca) is a large cat species and the 
    only living member of the genus Panthera native to the Americas. 
    With a body length of up to 1.85 m (6 ft 1 in) and a weight of up to 
    158 kg (348 lb), it is the largest cat species in the Americas and the
    third largest in the world. Its distinctively marked coat features pale
    yellow to tan colored fur covered by spots that transition to rosettes on
    the sides, although a melanistic black coat appears in some individuals. 
    The jaguar's powerful bite allows it to pierce the carapaces of turtles
    and tortoises, and to employ an unusual killing method: it bites directly 
    through the skull of mammalian prey between the ears to deliver 
    a fatal blow to the brain.
